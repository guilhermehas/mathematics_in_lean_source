Logic
=====

In the last chapter, we dealt with equations, inequalities,
and basic mathematical statements like
":math:`x` divides :math:`y`."
Complex mathematical statements are built up from
simple ones like these
using logical terms like "and," "or," "not," and
"if ... then," "every," and "some."
In this chapter, we show you how to work with statements
that are built up in this way.


.. _implication_and_the_universal_quantifier:

Implication and the Universal Quantifier
----------------------------------------

Consider the statement after the ``#check``:

.. code-block:: lean

    import data.real.basic

    -- BEGIN
    #check ∀ x y ε : ℝ,
      0 < ε → ε ≤ 1 → abs x < ε → abs y < ε → abs (x * y) < ε
    -- END

In words, we would say "for every ``x``, ``y``, and ``ε``,
if ``0 < ε ≤ 1``, the absolute value of ``x`` is less than ``ε``,
and the absolute value of ``y`` is less than ``ε``,
then the absolute value of ``x * y`` is less than ``ε``."
In Lean, in a sequence of implications there are
implicit parentheses grouped to the right.
So the expression above means
"if ``0 < ε`` then if ε ≤ 1 then if ``abs x < ε`` ..."
As a result, the expression says that all the
assumptions together imply the conclusion.

You have already seen that even though the universal quantifier
in this statement
ranges over objects and the implication arrows introduce hypotheses,
Lean treats the two in very similar ways.
In particular, if you have proved a theorem of that form,
you can apply it to objects and hypotheses in the same way:

.. code-block:: lean

    import data.real.basic

    -- BEGIN
    lemma my_lemma : ∀ x y ε : ℝ,
      0 < ε → ε ≤ 1 → abs x < ε → abs y < ε → abs (x * y) < ε :=
    sorry

    section
      variables a b δ : ℝ
      variables (h₀ : 0 < δ) (h₁ : δ ≤ 1)
      variables (ha : abs a < δ) (hb : abs b < δ)

      #check my_lemma a b δ
      #check my_lemma a b δ h₀ h₁
      #check my_lemma a b δ h₀ h₁ ha hb
    end
    -- END

You have also already seen that it is common in Lean
to use curly brackets to make quantified variables implicit
when they can be inferred from subsequent hypotheses.
When we do that, we can just apply a lemma to the hypotheses without
mentioning the objects.

.. code-block:: lean

    import data.real.basic

    -- BEGIN
    lemma my_lemma : ∀ {x y ε : ℝ},
      0 < ε → ε ≤ 1 → abs x < ε → abs y < ε → abs (x * y) < ε :=
    sorry

    section
      variables a b δ : ℝ
      variables (h₀ : 0 < δ) (h₁ : δ ≤ 1)
      variables (ha : abs a < δ) (hb : abs b < δ)

      #check my_lemma h₀ h₁ ha hb
    end
    -- END

At this stage, you also know that if you use
the ``apply`` tactic to apply ``my_lemma``
to a goal of the form ``abs (a * b) < δ``,
you are left with new goals that require you to  prove
each of the hypotheses.

To prove a statement like this, use the ``intros`` tactic.
Take a look at what it does in this example:

.. code-block:: lean

    import data.real.basic

    -- BEGIN
    lemma my_lemma : ∀ {x y ε : ℝ},
      0 < ε → ε ≤ 1 → abs x < ε → abs y < ε → abs (x * y) < ε :=
    begin
      intros x y ε epos ele1 xlt ylt,
      sorry
    end
    -- END

We can use any names we want for the universally quantified variables;
they do not have to be ``x``, ``y``, and ``ε``.
Notice that we have to introduce the variables
even though they are marked implicit:
making them implicit means that we leave them out when
we write an expression,
but they are still an essential part of the statement
that we are proving.
After the ``intros`` command,
the goal is what it would have been at the start if we
listed all the variables and hypotheses *before* the colon,
as we did in the last section.
In a moment, we will see why it is sometimes necessary to
introduce variables and hypotheses after the proof begins.

To help you prove the lemma, we will start you off:

.. code-block:: lean

    import data.real.basic

    -- BEGIN
    lemma my_lemma : ∀ {x y ε : ℝ},
      0 < ε → ε ≤ 1 → abs x < ε → abs y < ε → abs (x * y) < ε :=
    begin
      intros x y ε epos ele1 xlt ylt,
      calc
        abs (x * y) = abs x * abs y : sorry
        ... ≤ abs x * ε             : sorry
        ... < 1 * ε                 : sorry
        ... = ε                     : sorry
    end
    -- END

.. TODO: delete this eventually, but remember to
   introduce ``suffices`` eventually

.. We have introduced another new tactic here:
   ``suffices`` works like ``have`` in reverse,
   asking you to prove the goal using the
   stated fact,
   and then leaving you the new goal of proving that fact.

Finish the proof using the theorems
``abs_mul``, ``mul_le_mul``, ``abs_nonneg``,
``mul_lt_mul_right``, and ``one_mul``.
Remember that you can find theorems like these using
tab completion.
Remember also that you can use ``.mp`` and ``.mpr``
or ``.1`` and ``.2`` to extract the two directions
of an if-and-only-if statement.

Universal quantifiers are often hidden in definitions,
and Lean will unfold definitions to expose them when necessary.
For example, let's define two predicates,
``fn_ub f a`` and ``fn_lb f a``,
where ``f`` is a function from the real numbers to the real
numbers and ``a`` is a real number.
The first says that ``a`` is an upper bound on the
values of ``f``,
and the second says that ``a`` is a lower bound
on the values of ``f``.

.. code-block:: lean

    import data.real.basic

    -- BEGIN
    def fn_ub (f : ℝ → ℝ) (a : ℝ) : Prop := ∀ x, f x ≤ a
    def fn_lb (f : ℝ → ℝ) (a : ℝ) : Prop := ∀ x, a ≤ f x
    -- END

In the next example, remember that ``λ x, f x + g x`` is the
function that maps ``x`` to ``f x + g x``.

.. code-block:: lean

    import data.real.basic

    def fn_ub (f : ℝ → ℝ) (a : ℝ) : Prop := ∀ x, f x ≤ a
    def fn_lb (f : ℝ → ℝ) (a : ℝ) : Prop := ∀ x, a ≤ f x

    variables (f g : ℝ → ℝ) (a b : ℝ)

    -- BEGIN
    example (hfa : fn_ub f a) (hgb : fn_ub g b) :
      fn_ub (λ x, f x + g x) (a + b) :=
    begin
      intro x,
      dsimp,
      apply add_le_add,
      apply hfa,
      apply hgb
    end
    -- END

Applying ``intro`` to the predicate ``fn_ub (λ x, f x + g x) (a + b)``
forces Lean to unfold the definition of ``fn_ub``
and introduce ``x`` for the universal quantifier.
The goal is then ``(λ (x : ℝ), f x + g x) x ≤ a + b``.
But applying ``(λ x, f x + g x)`` to ``x`` should result in ``f x + g x``,
and the ``dsimp`` command performs that simplification.
(The "d" stands for "definitional.")
You can delete that command and the proof still works;
Lean would have to perform that contraction anyhow to make
sense of the next ``apply``.
The ``dsimp`` command simply makes the goal more readable
and helps us figure out what to do next.
Another option is to use the ``change`` tactic
by writing ``change f x + g x ≤ a + b``.
This helps make the proof more readable,
and gives you more control over how the goal is transformed.

The rest of the proof is routine.
The last two ``apply`` commands force Lean to unfold the definitions
of ``fn_ub`` in the hypotheses.
Try carrying out similar proofs of these:

.. code-block:: lean

    import data.real.basic

    def fn_ub (f : ℝ → ℝ) (a : ℝ) : Prop := ∀ x, f x ≤ a
    def fn_lb (f : ℝ → ℝ) (a : ℝ) : Prop := ∀ x, a ≤ f x

    variables (f g : ℝ → ℝ) (a b : ℝ)

    -- BEGIN
    example (hfa : fn_lb f a) (hgb : fn_lb g b) :
      fn_lb (λ x, f x + g x) (a + b) :=
    sorry

    example (nnf : fn_lb f 0) (nng : fn_lb g 0) :
      fn_lb (λ x, f x * g x) 0 :=
    sorry

    example (hfa : fn_ub f a) (hfb : fn_ub g b)
        (nng : fn_lb g 0) (nna : 0 ≤ a) :
      fn_ub (λ x, f x * g x) (a * b) :=
    sorry
    -- END

Even though we have defined ``fn_ub`` and ``fn_lb`` for functions
from the reals to the reals,
you should recognize that the definitions and proofs are much
more general.
The definitions make sense for functions between any two types
for which there is a notion of order on the codomain.
Checking the type of the theorem ``add_le_add`` shows that it holds
of any structure that is an "ordered additive commutative monoid";
the details of what that means don't matter now,
but it is worth knowing that the natural numbers, integers, rationals,
and real numbers are all instances.
So if we prove the theorem ``fn_ub_add`` at that level of generality,
it will apply in all these instances.

.. code-block:: lean

    variables {α : Type*} {R : Type*} [ordered_cancel_add_comm_monoid R]

    #check @add_le_add

    def fn_ub (f : α → R) (a : R) : Prop := ∀ x, f x ≤ a

    theorem fn_ub_add {f g : α → R} {a b : R}
        (hfa : fn_ub f a) (hgb : fn_ub g b) :
      fn_ub (λ x, f x + g x) (a + b) :=
    λ x, add_le_add (hfa x) (hgb x)

You have already seen square brackets like these in
Section :numref:`proving_identities_in_algebraic_structures`,
though we still haven't explained what they mean.
For concreteness, we will stick to the real numbers
for most of our examples,
but it is worth knowing that mathlib contains definitions and theorems
that work at a high level of generality.

For another example of a hidden universal quantifier,
mathlib defines a predicate ``monotone``,
which says that a function is nondecreasing in its arguments:

.. code-block:: lean

    import data.real.basic

    -- BEGIN
    example (f : ℝ → ℝ) (h : monotone f) :
      ∀ {a b}, a ≤ b → f a ≤ f b := h
    -- END

Proving statements about monotonicity
involves using ``intros`` to introduce two variables,
say, ``a`` and ``b``, and the hypothesis ``a ≤ b``.
To *use* a monotonicity hypothesis,
you can apply it to suitable arguments and hypotheses,
and then apply the resulting expression to the goal.
Or you can apply it to the goal and let Lean help you
work backwards by displaying the remaining hypotheses
as new subgoals.

.. code-block:: lean

    import data.real.basic

    variables (f g : ℝ → ℝ)

    -- BEGIN
    example (mf : monotone f) (mg : monotone g) :
      monotone (λ x, f x + g x) :=
    begin
      intros a b aleb,
      apply add_le_add,
      apply mf aleb,
      apply mg aleb
    end
    -- END

When a proof is this short, it is often convenient
to give a proof term instead.
The ``intros`` command corresponds to a lambda,
and the remaining term consists of applications.

.. code-block:: lean

    import data.real.basic

    variables (f g : ℝ → ℝ)

    -- BEGIN
    example (mf : monotone f) (mg : monotone g) :
      monotone (λ x, f x + g x) :=
    λ a b aleb, add_le_add (mf aleb) (mg aleb)
    -- END

Here is a useful trick: if you start writing
the proof term ``λ a b aleb, _`` using
an underscore where the rest of the
expression should go,
Lean will flag an error,
indicating that it can't guess the value of that expression.
If you check the Lean Goal window in VS Code or
hover over the squiggly error marker,
Lean will show you the goal that the remaining
expression has to solve.

Try proving these, with either tactics or proof terms:

.. code-block:: lean

    import data.real.basic

    variables (f g : ℝ → ℝ)

    -- BEGIN
    example {c : ℝ} (mf : monotone f) (nnc : 0 ≤ c) :
      monotone (λ x, c * f x) :=
    sorry

    example (mf : monotone f) (mg : monotone g) :
      monotone (λ x, f (g x)) :=
    sorry
    -- END

Here are some more examples.
A function :math:`f` from :math:`\Bbb R` to
:math:`\Bbb R` is said to be *even* if
:math:`f(-x) = f(x)` for every :math:`x`,
and *odd* if :math:`f(-x) = -f(x)` for every :math:`x`.
The following example defines these two notions formally
and establishes one fact about them.
You can complete the proofs of the others.

.. code-block:: lean

    import data.real.basic

    variables (f g : ℝ → ℝ)

    -- BEGIN
    def even (f : ℝ → ℝ) : Prop := ∀ x, f x = f (-x)
    def odd (f : ℝ → ℝ) : Prop := ∀ x, f x = - f (-x)

    example (ef : even f) (eg : even g) : even (λ x, f x + g x) :=
    begin
      intro x,
      calc
        (λ x, f x + g x) x = f x + g x       : rfl
                       ... = f (-x) + g (-x) : by rw [ef, eg]
    end

    example (of : odd f) (og : odd g) : even (λ x, f x * g x) :=
    sorry

    example (ef : even f) (og : odd g) : odd (λ x, f x * g x) :=
    sorry

    example (ef : even f) (og : odd g) : even (λ x, f (g x)) :=
    sorry
    -- END

The first proof can be shortened using ``dsimp`` or ``change``
to get rid of the lambda.
But you can check that the subsequent ``rw`` won't work
unless we get rid of the lambda explicitly,
because otherwise it cannot find the patterns ``f x`` and ``g x``
in the expression.

You can find implicit universal quantifiers all over the place,
once you know how to spot them.
Mathlib includes a good library for rudimentary set theory.
Lean's logical foundation imposes the restriction that when
we talk about sets, we are always talking about sets of
elements of some type. If ``x`` has type ``α`` and ``s`` has
type ``set α``, then ``x ∈ s`` is a proposition that
asserts that ``x`` is an element of ``s``.
If ``s`` and ``t`` are of type ``set α``,
then the subset relation ``s ⊆ t`` is defined to mean
``∀ {x : α}, x ∈ s → x ∈ t``.
The variable in the quantifier is marked implicit so that
given ``h : s ⊆ t`` and ``h' : x ∈ s``,
we can write ``h h'`` as justification for ``x ∈ t``.
The following example provides a tactic proof and a proof term
justifying the reflexivity of the subset relation,
and asks you to do the same for transitivity.

.. code-block:: lean

    variables {α : Type*} (r s t : set α)

    example : s ⊆ s :=
    by { intros x xs, exact xs }

    example : s ⊆ s := λ x xs, xs

    example : r ⊆ s → s ⊆ t → r ⊆ t :=
    begin
      sorry
    end

    example : r ⊆ s → s ⊆ t → r ⊆ t :=
    sorry

Just as we defined ``fn_ub`` for functions,
we can define ``set_ub s a`` to mean that ``a``
is an upper bound on the set ``s``,
assuming ``s`` is a set of elements of some type that
has an order associated with it.
In the next example, we ask you to prove that
if ``a`` is a bound on ``s`` and ``a ≤ b``,
then ``b`` is a bound on ``s`` as well.

.. code-block:: lean

    variables {α : Type*} [partial_order α]
    variables (s : set α) (a b : α)

    def set_ub (s : set α) (a : α) := ∀ x, x ∈ s → x ≤ a

    example (h : set_ub s a) (h' : a ≤ b) : set_ub s b :=
    sorry

We close this section with one last important example.
A function :math:`f` is said to be *injective* if for
every :math:`x_1` and :math:`x_2`,
if :math:`f(x_1) = f(x_2)` then :math:`x_1 = x_2`.
Mathlib defines ``function.injective f`` with
``x₁`` and ``x₂`` implicit.
The next example shows that, on the real numbers,
any function that adds a constant is injective.
We then ask you to show that multiplication by a nonzero
constant is also injective.

.. code-block:: lean

    import data.real.basic

    -- BEGIN
    open function

    example (c : ℝ) : injective (λ x, x + c) :=
    begin
      intros x₁ x₂ h',
      apply eq_of_add_eq_add_right h',
    end

    example {c : ℝ} (h : c ≠ 0) : injective (λ x, c * x) :=
    sorry
    -- END

Finally, show that the composition of two injective functions is injective:

.. code-block:: lean

    open function

    -- BEGIN
    variables {α : Type*} {β : Type*} {γ : Type*}
    variables {g : β → γ} {f : α → β}

    example (injg : injective g) (injf : injective f) :
      injective (λ x, g (f x)) :=
    begin
      intros x₁ x₂ h,
      apply injf,
      apply injg,
      apply h
    end
    -- END


.. _the_existential_quantifier:

The Existential Quantifier
--------------------------

.. TODO: add section reference for "and"

The existential quantifier, which can be entered as ``\ex`` in VS Code,
is used to represent the phrase "there exists."
The formal expression ``∃ x : ℝ, 2 < x ∧ x < 3`` in Lean says
that there is a real number between 2 and 3.
(We will discuss the conjunction symbol, ``∧``, below.)
The canonical way to prove such a statement is to exhibit a real number
and show that it has the stated property.
The number 2.5, which we can enter as ``5 / 2``
or ``(5 : ℝ) / 2`` when Lean cannot infer from context that we have
the real numbers in mind, has the required property,
and the ``norm_num`` tactic can prove that it meets the description.

There are a few ways we can put the information together.
Given a goal that begins with an existential quantifier,
the ``use`` tactic is used to provide the object,
leaving the goal of proving the property.

.. code-block:: lean

    import data.real.basic

    example : ∃ x : ℝ, 2 < x ∧ x < 3 :=
    begin
      use 5 / 2,
      norm_num
    end

Alternatively, we can use Lean's *anonyomous constructor* notation
to construct the proof.

.. code-block:: lean

    import data.real.basic

    -- BEGIN
    example : ∃ x : ℝ, 2 < x ∧ x < 3 :=
    begin
      have h : 2 < (5 : ℝ) / 2 ∧ (5 : ℝ) / 2 < 3,
        by norm_num,
      exact ⟨5 / 2, h⟩
    end
    -- END

The left and right brackets,
which can be entered as ``\<`` and ``\>`` respectively,
tell Lean to put together the given data using
whatever construction is appropriate
for the current goal.
We can use the notation without going into tactic mode:

.. code-block:: lean

    import data.real.basic

    -- BEGIN
    example : ∃ x : ℝ, 2 < x ∧ x < 3 :=
    ⟨5 / 2, by norm_num⟩
    -- END

So now we know how to *prove* an exists statement.
But how do we *use* one?
If we know that there exists an object with a certain property,
we should be able to give a name to an arbitrary one
and reason about it.
For example, remember the predicates ``fn_ub f a`` and ``fn_lb f a``
from the last section,
which say that ``a`` is an upper bound or lower bound on ``f``,
respectively.
We can use the existential quantifier to say that "``f`` if bounded"
without specifying the bound:

.. code-block:: lean

    import data.real.basic

    -- BEGIN
    def fn_ub (f : ℝ → ℝ) (a : ℝ) : Prop := ∀ x, f x ≤ a
    def fn_lb (f : ℝ → ℝ) (a : ℝ) : Prop := ∀ x, a ≤ f x

    def fn_has_ub (f : ℝ → ℝ) := ∃ a, fn_ub f a
    def fn_has_lb (f : ℝ → ℝ) := ∃ a, fn_lb f a
    -- END

We can use the theorem ``fn_ub_add`` from the last section
to prove that if ``f`` and ``g`` have upper bounds,
then so does ``λ x, f x + g x``.

.. code-block:: lean

    import data.real.basic

    def fn_ub (f : ℝ → ℝ) (a : ℝ) : Prop := ∀ x, f x ≤ a
    def fn_lb (f : ℝ → ℝ) (a : ℝ) : Prop := ∀ x, a ≤ f x

    def fn_has_ub (f : ℝ → ℝ) := ∃ a, fn_ub f a
    def fn_has_lb (f : ℝ → ℝ) := ∃ a, fn_lb f a

    theorem fn_ub_add {f g : ℝ → ℝ} {a b : ℝ}
        (hfa : fn_ub f a) (hgb : fn_ub g b) :
      fn_ub (λ x, f x + g x) (a + b) :=
    λ x, add_le_add (hfa x) (hgb x)

    variables {f g : ℝ → ℝ}

    -- BEGIN
    example (ubf : fn_has_ub f) (ubg : fn_has_ub g) :
      fn_has_ub (λ x, f x + g x) :=
    begin
      cases ubf with a ubfa,
      cases ubg with b ubfb,
      use a + b,
      apply fn_ub_add ubfa ubfb
    end
    -- END

The ``cases`` tactic unpacks the information
in the existential quantifier.
Given the hypothesis ``ubf`` that there is an upper bound
for ``f``,
``cases`` adds a new variable for an upper
bound to the context,
together with the hypothesis that it has the given property.
The ``with`` clause allows us to specify the names
we want Lean to use.
The goal is left unchanged;
what *has* changed is that we can now use
the new object and the new hypothesis
to prove the goal.
This is a common pattern in mathematics:
we unpack objects whose existence is asserted or implied
by some hypothesis, and then use it to establish the existence
of something else.

Try using this pattern to establish the following.
You might find it useful to turn some of the examples
from the last section into named theorems,
as we did with ``fn_ub_add``,
or you can insert the arguments directly
into the proofs.

.. code-block:: lean

    import data.real.basic

    def fn_ub (f : ℝ → ℝ) (a : ℝ) : Prop := ∀ x, f x ≤ a
    def fn_lb (f : ℝ → ℝ) (a : ℝ) : Prop := ∀ x, a ≤ f x

    def fn_has_ub (f : ℝ → ℝ) := ∃ a, fn_ub f a
    def fn_has_lb (f : ℝ → ℝ) := ∃ a, fn_lb f a

    variables {f g : ℝ → ℝ}

    -- BEGIN
    example (lbf : fn_has_lb f) (lbg : fn_has_lb g) :
      fn_has_lb (λ x, f x + g x) :=
    sorry

    example {c : ℝ} (ubf : fn_has_ub f) (h : c ≥ 0):
      fn_has_ub (λ x, c * f x) :=
    sorry
    -- END

The task of unpacking information in a hypothesis is
so important that Lean and mathlib provide a number of
ways to do it.
A cousin of the ``cases`` tactic, ``rcases``, is more
flexible in that it allows us to unpack nested data.
(The "r" stands for "recursive.")
In the ``with`` clause for unpacking an existential quantifier,
we name the object and the hypothesis by presenting
them as a pattern ``⟨a, h⟩`` that ``rcases`` then tries to match.
The ``rintro`` tactic (which can also be written ``rintros``)
is a combination of ``intros`` and ``rcases``.
These examples illustrate their use:

.. code-block:: lean

    import data.real.basic

    def fn_ub (f : ℝ → ℝ) (a : ℝ) : Prop := ∀ x, f x ≤ a
    def fn_lb (f : ℝ → ℝ) (a : ℝ) : Prop := ∀ x, a ≤ f x

    def fn_has_ub (f : ℝ → ℝ) := ∃ a, fn_ub f a
    def fn_has_lb (f : ℝ → ℝ) := ∃ a, fn_lb f a

    variables {f g : ℝ → ℝ}

      exact ⟨a + b, fn_ub_add ubfa ubfb⟩
    end
    -- END

In fact, Lean also supports a pattern-matching lambda
in expressions and proof terms:

.. code-block:: lean

    import data.real.basic

    def fn_ub (f : ℝ → ℝ) (a : ℝ) : Prop := ∀ x, f x ≤ a
    def fn_lb (f : ℝ → ℝ) (a : ℝ) : Prop := ∀ x, a ≤ f x

    def fn_has_ub (f : ℝ → ℝ) := ∃ a, fn_ub f a
    def fn_has_lb (f : ℝ → ℝ) := ∃ a, fn_lb f a

    variables {f g : ℝ → ℝ}

    theorem fn_ub_add {f g : ℝ → ℝ} {a b : ℝ}
        (hfa : fn_ub f a) (hgb : fn_ub g b) :
        fn_ub (λ x, f x + g x) (a + b) :=
    λ x, add_le_add (hfa x) (hgb x)

    -- BEGIN
    example : fn_has_ub f → fn_has_ub g →
      fn_has_ub (λ x, f x + g x) :=
    λ ⟨a, ubfa⟩ ⟨b, ubfb⟩, ⟨a + b, fn_ub_add ubfa ubfb⟩
    -- END

These are power-user moves, and there is no harm
in favoring the use of ``cases`` until you are more comfortable
with the existential quantifier.
But we will come to learn that all of these tools,
including ``cases``, use, and the anonymous constructors,
are like Swiss army knives when it comes to theorem proving.
They can be used for a wide range of purposes,
not just for unpacking exists statements.

To illustrate one way that ``rcases`` can be used,
we prove an old mathematical chestnut:
if two integers ``x`` and ``y`` can each be written as
a sum of two squares,
then so can their product, ``x * y``.
In fact, the statement is true for any commutative
ring, not just the integers.
In the next example, ``rcases`` unpacks two existential
quantifiers at once.
We then provide the magic values needed to express ``x * y``
as a sum of squares as a list to the ``use`` statement,
and we use ``ring`` to verify that they work.

.. code-block:: lean

    import tactic

    variables {α : Type*} [comm_ring α]

    def sum_of_squares (x : α) := ∃ a b, x = a^2 + b^2

    theorem sum_of_squares_mul {x y : α}
        (sosx : sum_of_squares x) (sosy : sum_of_squares y) :
      sum_of_squares (x * y) :=
    begin
      rcases sosx with ⟨a, b, xeq⟩,
      rcases sosy with ⟨c, d, yeq⟩,
      rw [xeq, yeq],
      use [a*c - b*d, a*d + b*c],
      ring
    end

This pattern of unpacking an equation inside a existential quantifier
and then using it to rewrite an expression in the goal
come up often,
so much so that the ``rcases`` tactic provides
an abbreviation:
if you use the keyword ``rfl`` in place of a new identifier,
``rcases`` does the rewriting automatically.

.. code-block:: lean

    import tactic

    variables {α : Type*} [comm_ring α]

    def sum_of_squares (x : α) := ∃ a b, x = a^2 + b^2

    -- BEGIN
    theorem sum_of_squares_mul {x y : α}
        (sosx : sum_of_squares x) (sosy : sum_of_squares y) :
      sum_of_squares (x * y) :=
    begin
      rcases sosx with ⟨a, b, rfl⟩,
      rcases sosy with ⟨c, d, rfl⟩,
      use [a*c - b*d, a*d + b*c],
      ring
    end
    -- END

As with the universal quantifier,
you can find existential quantifiers hidden all over
if you know how to spot them.
For example, divisibility is implicitly an "exists" statement.

.. code-block:: lean

    import tactic

    variables {a b c : ℕ}

    -- BEGIN
    example (divab : a ∣ b) (divbc : b ∣ c) : a ∣ c :=
    begin
      cases divab with d beq,
      cases divbc with e ceq,
      rw [ceq, beq],
      use (d * e), ring
    end
    -- END

And once again, this provides a nice setting for using
``rcases`` with ``rfl``.
Try it out in the proof above.
It feels pretty good!

Then try proving the following:

.. code-block:: lean

    import tactic

    variables {a b c : ℕ}

    -- BEGIN
    example (divab : a ∣ b) (divac : a ∣ c) : a ∣ (b + c) :=
    sorry
    -- END

For another important example, a function :math:`f : \alpha \to \beta`
is said to be *surjective* if for every :math:`y` in the
codomain, :math:`\beta`,
there is an :math:`x` in the domain, :math:`\alpha`,
such that :math:`f(x) = y`.
Notice that this statement includes both a universal
and an existential quantifier, which explains
why the next example makes use of both ``intro`` and ``use``.

.. code-block:: lean

    import data.real.basic

    open function

    -- BEGIN
    example {c : ℝ} : surjective (λ x, x + c) :=
    begin
      intro x,
      use x - c,
      dsimp, ring
    end
    -- END

Try this example yourself:

.. code-block:: lean

    import data.real.basic

    open function

    -- BEGIN
    example {c : ℝ} (h : c ≠ 0) : surjective (λ x, c * x) :=
    sorry
    -- END

You can use the theorem ``div_mul_cancel``.
The next example uses a surjectivity hypothesis
by applying it to a suitable value.
Note that you can use ``cases`` with any expression,
not just a hypothesis.

.. code-block:: lean

    import data.real.basic

    open function

    -- BEGIN
    example {f : ℝ → ℝ} (h : surjective f) : ∃ x, (f x)^2 = 4 :=
    begin
      cases h 2 with x hx,
      use x,
      rw hx,
      norm_num
    end
    -- END

See if you can use these methods to show that
the composition of surjective functions is surjective.

.. code-block:: lean

    import tactic

    open function

    variables {α : Type*} {β : Type*} {γ : Type*}
    variables {g : β → γ} {f : α → β}

    -- BEGIN
    example (surjg : surjective g) (surjf : surjective f) :
      surjective (λ x, g (f x)) :=
    sorry
    -- END


.. _sequences_and_convergence:

Sequences and Convergence
-------------------------

We now have enough skills at our disposal to do some real mathematics.
In Lean, we can represent a sequence :math:`s_0, s_1, s_2, \ldots` of
real numbers as a function ``s : ℕ → ℝ``.
Such a sequence is said to *converge* to a number :math:`a` if for every
:math:`\varepsilon > 0` there is a point beyond which the sequence
remains within :math:`\varepsilon` of :math:`a`,
that is, there is a number :math:`N` such that for every
:math:`n \ge N`, :math:`| s_n - a | < \varepsilon`.
In Lean, we can render this as follows:

.. code-block:: lean

    import data.real.basic

    -- BEGIN
    def converges_to (s : ℕ → ℝ) (a : ℝ) :=
    ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, abs (s n - a) < ε
    -- END

The notation ``∀ ε > 0, ...`` is a convenient abbreviation
for ``∀ ε, ε > 0 → ...``, and, similarly,
``∀ n ≥ N, ...`` abbreviates ``∀ n, n ≥ N →  ...``.
And remember that ``ε > 0``, in turn, is defined as ``0 < ε``,
and ``n ≥ N`` is defined as ``N ≤ n``.

In this section, we'll establish some properties of convergence.
But first, we will discuss three tactics for working equality
that will prove useful.
The first, the ``ext`` tactic,
gives us a way of proving that two functions are equal.
Let :math:`f(x) = x + 1` and :math:`g(x) = 1 + x`
be functions from reals to reals.
Then, of course, :math:`f = g`, because they return the same
value for every :math:`x`.
The ``ext`` tactic enables us to prove an equation between functions
by proving that their values are the same
at all the values of their arguments.

.. code-block:: lean

    import data.real.basic

    -- BEGIN
    example : (λ x y : ℝ, (x + y)^2) = (λ x y : ℝ, x^2 + 2*x*y + y^2) :=
    by { ext, ring }
    -- END

The second tactic, the ``congr`` tactic,
allows us to prove an equation between two expressions
by reconciling the parts that are different:

.. code-block:: lean

    import data.real.basic

    -- BEGIN
    example (a b : ℝ) : abs a = abs (a - b + b) :=
    by  { congr, ring }
    -- END

Here the ``congr`` tactic peels off the ``abs`` on each side,
leaving us to prove ``a = a - b + b``.

Finally, the ``convert`` tactic is used to apply a theorem
to a goal when the conclusion of the theorem doesn't quite match.
For example, suppose we want to prove ``a < a * a`` from ``1 < a``.
A theorem in the library, ``mul_lt_mul_right``,
will let us prove ``1 * a < a * a``.
One possibility is to work backwards and rewrite the goal
so that it has that form.
Instead, the ``convert`` tactic lets us apply the theorem
as it is,
and leaves us with the task of proving the equations that
are needed to make the goal match.

.. code-block:: lean

    import data.real.basic

    -- BEGIN
    example {a : ℝ} (h : 1 < a) : a < a * a :=
    begin
      convert (mul_lt_mul_right _).2 h,
      { rw [one_mul] },
      exact lt_trans zero_lt_one h
    end
    -- END

This example illustrates another useful trick: when we apply an
expression with an underscore
and Lean can't fill it in for us automatically,
it simply leaves it for us as another goal.

The following shows that any constant sequence :math:`a, a, a, \ldots`
converges.

.. code-block:: lean

    import data.real.basic

    def converges_to (s : ℕ → ℝ) (a : ℝ) :=
    ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, abs (s n - a) < ε

    variable (a : ℝ)

    -- BEGIN
    theorem converges_to_const : converges_to (λ x : ℕ, a) a :=
    begin
      intros ε εpos,
      use 0,
      intros n nge, dsimp,
      rw [sub_self, abs_zero],
      apply εpos
    end
    -- END

.. TODO: reference to the simplifier

Lean has a tactic, ``simp``, which can often save you the
trouble of carrying out steps like ``rw [sub_self, abs_zero]``
by hand.
We will tell you more about it soon.

For a more interesting theorem, let's show that if ``s``
converges to ``a`` and ``t`` converges to ``b``, then
``λ n, s n + t n`` converges to ``a + b``.
It is helpful to have a clear pen-and-paper
proof in mind before you start writing a formal one.
Given ``ε`` greater than ``0``,
the idea is to use the hypotheses to obtain an ``Ns``
such that beyond that point, ``s`` is within ``ε / 2``
of ``a``,
and an ``Nt`` such that beyond that point, ``t`` is within
``ε / 2`` of ``b``.
Then, whenever ``n`` is greater than or equal to the
maximum of ``Ns`` and ``Nt``,
the sequence ``λ n, s n + t n`` should be within ``ε``
of ``a + b``.
The following example begins to implement this strategy.
See if you can finish it off.

.. code-block:: lean

    import data.real.basic

    def converges_to (s : ℕ → ℝ) (a : ℝ) :=
    ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, abs (s n - a) < ε

    -- BEGIN
    variables {s t : ℕ → ℝ} {a b : ℝ}

    theorem converges_to_add
      (cs : converges_to s a) (ct : converges_to t b):
    converges_to (λ n, s n + t n) (a + b) :=
    begin
      intros ε εpos, dsimp,
      have ε2pos : 0 < ε / 2,
      { linarith },
      cases cs (ε / 2) ε2pos with Ns hs,
      cases ct (ε / 2) ε2pos with Nt ht,
      use max Ns Nt,
      sorry
    end
    -- END

As hints, you can use ``le_of_max_le_left`` and ``le_of_max_le_right``,
and ``norm_num`` can prove ``ε / 2 + ε / 2 = ε``.
Also, it is helpful to use the ``congr`` tactic to
show that ``abs (s n + t n - (a + b))`` is equal to
``abs ((s n - a) + (t n - b)),``
since then you can use the triangle inequality.
Notice that we marked all the variables ``s``, ``t``, ``a``, and ``b``
implicit because they can be inferred from the hypotheses.

Proving the same theorem with multiplication in place
of addition is tricky.
We will get there by proving some auxiliary statements first.
See if you can also finish off the next proof,
which shows that if ``s`` converges to ``a``,
then ``λ n, c * s n`` converges to ``c * a``.
It is helpful to split into cases depending on whether ``c``
is equal to zero or not.
Since we have not shown you how to do that yet,
we have taken care of the zero case first,
and we have left you to prove the result with
the extra assumption that ``c`` is nonzero.

.. code-block:: lean

    import data.real.basic

    def converges_to (s : ℕ → ℝ) (a : ℝ) :=
    ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, abs (s n - a) < ε

    theorem converges_to_const (a : ℝ) : converges_to (λ x : ℕ, a) a :=
    sorry

    variables {s : ℕ → ℝ} {a : ℝ}

    -- BEGIN
    theorem converges_to_mul_const
      {c : ℝ} (cs : converges_to s a) :
    converges_to (λ n, c * s n) (c * a) :=
    begin
      by_cases h : c = 0,
      { convert converges_to_const 0,
        { ext, rw [h, zero_mul] },
        rw [h, zero_mul] },
      have acpos : 0 < abs c,
        from abs_pos_of_ne_zero h,
      sorry
    end
    -- END

The next theorem is also independently interesting:
it shows that a convergent sequence is eventually bounded
in absolute value.
We have started you off; see if you can finish it.

.. code-block:: lean

    import data.real.basic

    def converges_to (s : ℕ → ℝ) (a : ℝ) :=
    ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, abs (s n - a) < ε

    variables {s : ℕ → ℝ} {a : ℝ}

    -- BEGIN
    theorem exists_abs_le_of_converges_to (cs : converges_to s a) :
      ∃ N b, ∀ n, N ≤ n → abs (s n) < b :=
    begin
      cases cs 1 zero_lt_one with N h,
      use [N, abs a + 1],
      sorry
    end
    -- END

In fact, the theorem could be strengthened to assert
that there is a bound ``b`` that holds for all values of ``n``.
But this version is strong enough for our purposes,
and we will see at the end of this section that it
holds more generally.

The next lemma is auxiliary: we prove that if
``s`` converges to ``a`` and ``t`` converges to ``0``,
then ``λ n, s n * t n`` converges to ``0``.
To do so, we use the previous theorem to find a ``B``
on ``s`` beyond some point ``N₀``.
See if you can understand the strategy we have outlined
and finish the proof.

.. code-block:: lean

    import data.real.basic

    def converges_to (s : ℕ → ℝ) (a : ℝ) :=
    ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, abs (s n - a) < ε

    variables {s t : ℕ → ℝ} {a : ℝ}

    theorem exists_abs_le_of_converges_to (cs : converges_to s a) :

      rcases exists_abs_le_of_converges_to cs with ⟨N₀, B, h₀⟩,
      have Bpos : 0 < B,
        from lt_of_le_of_lt (abs_nonneg _) (h₀ N₀ (le_refl _)),
      have pos₀ : ε / B > 0,
        from div_pos εpos Bpos,
      cases ct _ pos₀ with N₁ h₁,
      sorry
    end
    -- END

If you have made it this far, congratulations!
We are now within striking distance of our theorem.
The following proof finishes it off.

.. code-block:: lean

    import data.real.basic

    def converges_to (s : ℕ → ℝ) (a : ℝ) :=
    ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, abs (s n - a) < ε

      have h₁ : converges_to (λ n, s n * (t n - b)) 0,
      { apply aux cs,
        convert converges_to_add ct (converges_to_const (-b)),
        ring },
      convert (converges_to_add h₁ (converges_to_mul_const b cs)),
      { ext, ring },
      ring
    end
    -- END

We close the section with the observation that our proofs can be generalized.
For example, the only properties that we have used of the
natural numbers is that their structure carries a partial order
with ``min`` and ``max``.
You can check that everything still works if you replace ``ℕ``
everywhere by any linear order ``α``:

.. code-block:: lean

    import data.real.basic

    -- BEGIN
    variables {α : Type*} [linear_order α]

    def converges_to (s : α → ℝ) (a : ℝ) :=
    ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, abs (s n - a) < ε
    -- END

.. TODO: reference to later chapter

In a later chapter, we will see that mathlib has mechanisms
for dealing with convergence in vastly more general terms,
not only abstracting away particular features of the domain
and codomain,
but also abstracting over different types of convergence.
